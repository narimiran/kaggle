# Kaggle
My notebooks for Kaggle problems. Currently only for three datasets.  

"Kobe" and "Titanic" were done in May 2016, when I joined Kaggle to improve my data analysis / machine learning skills. "New Coders" is more recent.    
You don't have to have IPython/Jupyter Notebook, all notebooks are viewable in [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).

## Kobe
Notebooks for [Kobe Bryant Shot Selection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kobe-bryant-shot-selection) are split in two parts:
* [first part](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/narimiran/kaggle/blob/master/kobe-part1.ipynb) deals with data exploration
* [second part](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/narimiran/kaggle/blob/master/kobe-part2.ipynb) prepares the data for ML, and tests different ML algorithms

## Titanic
Notebooks for [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). Consists of two parts: 
* [Part I - exploratory analysis](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/narimiran/kaggle/blob/master/titanic-part1.ipynb)
* [Part II - machine learning](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/narimiran/kaggle/blob/master/titanic-part2.ipynb) - machine learning

## New Coders
Notebooks for [2016 New Coders Survey](https://www.kaggle.com/freecodecamp/2016-new-coder-survey-). Consists of two parts: 
* [Part I - univariate analysis](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/narimiran/kaggle/blob/master/new_coders-part1.ipynb)
* [Part II - multivariate analysis](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/narimiran/kaggle/blob/master/new_coders-part2.ipynb)
