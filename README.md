# Kaggle
My notebooks for Kaggle problems. Currently only three notebooks for two problems. Both of them were done in May 2016, when I joined Kaggle to improve my data analysis / machine learning skills.  
You don't have to have IPython/Jupyter Notebook, all notebooks are viewable in [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).

## Kobe
Notebooks for [Kobe Bryant Shot Selection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kobe-bryant-shot-selection) are split in two parts:
* [first part](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/narimiran/kaggle/blob/master/kobe-part1.ipynb) deals with data exploration
* [second part](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/narimiran/kaggle/blob/master/kobe-part2.ipynb) prepares the data for ML, and tests different ML algorithms

## Titanic
A notebook for [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). Consists of two parts: 
* [first part](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/narimiran/kaggle/blob/master/titanic-part1.ipynb) - exploratory analysis
* [second part](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/narimiran/kaggle/blob/master/titanic-part2.ipynb) - machine learning
